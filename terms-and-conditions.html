    <div class="note">
      <strong>Launch Offer:</strong> The Lifetime plan is currently available at ₹1,999 (60% off the regular price of ₹4,999). This is a limited-time promotional offer. Once purchased, you retain lifetime access at this price regardless of future price changes.
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Note:</strong> Pricing is subject to change for new subscribers. Existing subscribers will be notified at least 30 days in advance of any price changes for their recurring subscriptions (Pro/Ultra). Lifetime plan purchases are not affected by future price changes.
    </div>

    <h3>4.2 Billing & Payment</h3>
    <p>Payments are processed through <strong>Google Play Billing</strong>. By subscribing, you agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pay the subscription fee associated with your chosen plan</li>
      <li>Provide accurate and complete payment information to Google Play</li>
      <li>Comply with Google Play's payment terms and policies</li>
      <li>For recurring subscriptions (Pro/Ultra): Authorize Google Play to charge your payment method on a recurring monthly basis</li>
      <li>For one-time purchases (Lifetime): Authorize Google Play to process a single payment</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Lifetime Plan:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Lifetime plan is a <strong>one-time purchase</strong> with no recurring charges</li>
      <li>Once purchased, you have permanent access to all Ultra features</li>
      <li>The launch offer price (₹1,999) is locked in forever for your account</li>
      <li>Future price increases do not affect your lifetime access</li>
      <li>Lifetime access is tied to your account (non-transferable)</li>
      <li>If you delete your account, you lose lifetime access and must repurchase to regain it</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.3 Auto-Renewal</h3>
    <p><strong>Recurring Subscriptions (Pro/Ultra):</strong> Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle (monthly) unless you cancel before the renewal date. You will be charged the then-current subscription rate. To avoid being charged for the next billing cycle, you must cancel at least 24 hours before the renewal date.</p>

    <p><strong>Lifetime Plan:</strong> The Lifetime plan does NOT auto-renew because it is a one-time purchase. Once purchased, you have permanent access with no further charges.</p>

    <h3>4.4 Cancellation</h3>
    <p><strong>Recurring Subscriptions (Pro/Ultra):</strong> You may cancel your subscription at any time through the <strong>Google Play Store</strong>:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the Google Play Store app on your device</li>
      <li>Go to Menu → Subscriptions</li>
      <li>Select NewsHive and tap "Cancel Subscription"</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period. You will retain access to premium features until the end of the paid period. No partial refunds are provided for early cancellation.</p>

    <p><strong>Lifetime Plan:</strong> The Lifetime plan cannot be "cancelled" since it is a one-time purchase with no recurring charges. However, you may request a refund within the eligible refund window (see Section 5 - Refund Policy).</p>

    <div class="info-box">
      <strong>Important:</strong> NewsHive does not currently support in-app subscription cancellation. All subscription management must be done through Google Play Store.
    </div>

    <h3>4.5 Free Trial Period</h3>
    <p>The Free plan allows unlimited use of basic features without payment. There is no time-limited free trial for premium plans. Users may upgrade to Pro or Ultra at any time.</p>

    <h2>5. Refund Policy</h2>

    <h3>5.1 Eligibility for Refunds</h3>
    <p>We strive for customer satisfaction. Refunds may be granted under the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Technical Issues:</strong> If the App experiences significant technical problems preventing you from accessing premium features, and we are unable to resolve the issue within 7 days of your report</li>
      <li><strong>Billing Errors:</strong> If you were charged incorrectly or charged multiple times due to a system error</li>
      <li><strong>First-Time Subscription (Recurring Plans):</strong> If you cancel within 48 hours of your first subscription purchase and have not extensively used premium features</li>
      <li><strong>Lifetime Plan (Launch Offer Period):</strong> If you request a refund within 7 days of purchase, have not extensively used premium features (less than 50 AI summaries generated), and can demonstrate a valid reason</li>
      <li><strong>Unauthorized Charges:</strong> If your payment method was charged without your authorization (subject to verification)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.2 Refund Exclusions</h3>
    <p>Refunds will <strong>not</strong> be provided in the following cases:</p>

      <li><strong>Lifetime Plan:</strong> Refunds after 7 days of purchase or after generating more than 50 AI summaries</li>
      <li><strong>Lifetime Plan:</strong> Requests made after the launch offer period ends (offer period will be announced in-app)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="warning">
      <strong>Lifetime Plan Refund Policy:</strong> Due to the significantly discounted launch price (₹1,999 vs ₹4,999), lifetime plan refunds are more restrictive than recurring subscriptions. We encourage you to try the Free or Pro tier first before committing to a lifetime purchase.
    </div>

    <h3>5.3 Refund Process</h3>

    <ol>
